## Overview
The **ChatGPTWinFormsApp** is designed to enable easy interaction with OpenAI's GPT models for generating AI-powered conversational responses. The application allows users to:
- Ask questions in an easy-to-use interface.
- Copy answers or entire chat histories for later use.
- Start new conversations or reset the existing session.

This project is written in **C#** using the **Windows Forms** framework and adheres to modern development practices for maintainable and extensible code.
## Features
### End-User Features:
- A simple text input box for asking questions.
- Display the AI's response in real-time.
- Button to reset the current question for starting a new query.
- Ability to copy specific answers or the entire conversation to the clipboard.
- Functionality for starting a new chat session.

### Developer Features:
- Structured and extensible code with reusable components.
- Use of `OpenAIClient` class for interacting with OpenAI API.
- Resumable session history using `_contentHistory` (shared globally).
- Clear separation of UI and business logic.

## For End Users
### System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher.
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0 runtime (ensure it's installed on your system).
- **Internet Connection:** Required for accessing OpenAI's API.

### Installation
1. **Download the Application:**
    - Obtain the latest executable file (`ChatGPTWinFormsApp.exe`) from the [releases section]() (add a link here if hosted online).

2. **Install Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure `.NET 8.0` framework is installed. If not, you can download it [here]().

3. **Run the Application:**
    - Double-click the executable (`ChatGPTWinFormsApp.exe`) to launch the app.

### Usage Instructions
1. Open the application.
2. Enter your query in the **"Question"** text box.
3. Click the **"Ask"** button to send the question to ChatGPT.
4. View the AI-generated response in the **"Answer"** box.
5. You can:
    - Copy the response using the **"Copy Answer"** button.
    - Copy the entire chat history using the **"Copy Chat"** button.
    - Start a new chat session using the **"New Chat"** button.
    - Clear the current question with the **"Next Question"** button.

6. If needed, refer to the **History** panel to view the full conversation log.

## For Developers
### Pre-requisites
- Windows 10 or higher.
- JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio 2022, or any other modern IDE that supports .NET 8.0 development.
- .NET 8.0 SDK installed.
- Access to an OpenAI API Key (you must configure it in the `OpenAIClient` class).

### Code Structure
The application is structured into the following components:
1. **Main Form (`ChatGPTGUI`):**
    - Handles user interactions and UI logic.
    - Methods like `FillAnswer` and `AppendToChatHistory` manage chat updates.

2. **Shared Logic (`OpenAIClient`):**
    - Responsible for interacting with OpenAI's API.
    - Functions:
        - `ReadApiKey`: Reads the API key required for authenticating requests.
        - `GetOpenAIResponseGpt4`: Sends requests to the GPT model and retrieves responses.

3. **Global Session State (`_contentHistory`):**
    - A global variable to keep track of the ongoing conversation.

### Important Files
- `ChatGPTGUI.cs` - Main application file defining the UI and business logic.
- `OpenAIClient.cs` - Handles API interactions.
- `Program.cs` - Entry point for the application.
- `App.config` (optional) - Can be used for storing settings like API keys or user preferences.
